# Chordzzle

A [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) spinoff for guessing chords. This is a fun way to discover new chords, or new voicings for chords you already knew about!

## How To Play

Press the piano keys to input your answer. Voicing matters! (higher notes appear higher in the guess). The chords could be triads, but they could also be upper structures. However, the chord is always voiced using five notes.
