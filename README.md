# Chordzzle

A [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) spinoff for guessing chords. This is a fun way to discover new chords or new voicings for chords you already knew about!

## How To Play

Make sure your sound is on! Press the piano keys to input your answer. Voicing matters! (higher notes appear higher in the guess). The chord is always voiced using five notes, and you have six tries to find the correct chord. The answer can be played in any octave!

### Possible Notes
A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#

- Green Notes: In the chord and in the correct position
- Yellow Notes: In the chord but not in the correct position
- Gray Notes: Not in the chord
